# Personal Portfolio — Biswajyoti Nath  
Modern, minimal, neon-accented portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Showcases my work across **systems**, **security**, **software engineering**, and **research-aware projects**.

## 🚀 Overview
This portfolio introduces who I am and highlights my current interests across:

- Systems & low-level fundamentals  
- Cybersecurity and practical tooling  
- Modern web engineering  
- Research-aware topics like quantum-secure ideas (not the sole focus)  

The design is intentionally **clean, minimal, and fast**, with:

- Light/Dark theme toggle (persistent)
- Fast typing animation
- Smooth scroll-reveal animations
- Crisp neon accents (no blur)
- GitHub + LinkedIn icons in the navbar
- Fully responsive layout
